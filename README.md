Case Developed by Professor Chase Kusterer, Hult International Business School

# Apprentice-Chef-Inc.

Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Each meal set takes at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's awardwinning disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile app.

# Case Challenge: 
In an effort to diversify their revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There, a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product offering of hard to find local wines. Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset you received, and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience. They have tasked you with analyzing their data, developing your top insights, and building a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service.

# Top Business Insights:

1. About 45% of total customers who followed meal recommendations more than 20% of times on the platforms subscribed to Halfway There. Furthermore, there is a close positive relation with total photos viewed on the web and mobile platforms with these customers. This shows that these customers have great trust on the service of Apprentice Chef.

2. About 47% of total customers who have subscribed to Halfway There, have got full refund on meal cancellation before noon at least once. This is Apprentice Chef's cancellation policy on the meal orders. These customers may like the flexibility of Apprentice Chef's services and showcase customer loyalty towards getting the cross sell success. Furthermore, about 8% and 28% of total customers who are Junk email users and professional email users respectively have taken up on the promotion. About 41% of those who have used cancellation before noon at least once are professional email users. From the model, these are different niche segments that we could target for a cross sell success.
